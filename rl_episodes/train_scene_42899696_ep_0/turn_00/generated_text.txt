The current view is looking down a narrow space, likely a hallway or corridor, with a light source visible ahead and a curtain or partition on the right. Since the question states we begin at the TV facing the bed, and the current view is not aligned with that starting point, I need to explore to find the TV and bed. The view is obstructed, so I need to adjust my position to better understand the room layout. I will turn left to see more of the surrounding area and get a better sense of where the TV and bed are located.
