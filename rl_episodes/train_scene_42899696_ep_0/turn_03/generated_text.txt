I need to determine the correct sequence of turns to navigate from the TV facing the bed to the trash bin. The current view is from a position [0.84, 1.83, -0.49], which is looking down at a bed or similar structure. Based on the question, I need to navigate to the trash bin, which is described as being on my right after performing the second turn.

To solve this, I need to understand the spatial layout. The question states I start "facing the bed," which suggests the camera is oriented towards the bed. In the current view, I am looking at what appears to be a bed or a large structure. To navigate toward the trash bin, I need to understand what direction the trash bin is in relation to the bed.

Looking at the images, I see that from the current position, moving forward would take me toward the bed. However, the question mentions navigating "to the trash bin," which implies it is not directly in front of me, but rather to the side or behind. I need to turn to face a different direction.

Since I am currently facing the bed, to reach the trash bin, I would need to turn left or right to change my direction of travel. Given the layout, turning left would likely take me toward a wall or a corner, while turning right might take me toward another area of the room.

Based on the sequence described in the question, the first action is to turn either left or right, then go forward to a cabinet, then turn again, and finally go forward until the trash bin is on my right. This suggests that the trash bin is located in a specific quadrant relative to the starting point.

After analyzing the scene and considering the typical layout of a room, I believe turning right would be the correct first move to orient myself toward the area where the trash bin is likely located. Then, after reaching the cabinet, turning left would position me to face the trash bin directly, which would then be on my right as I move forward.

Therefore, the correct sequence is to turn right first, then turn left.
