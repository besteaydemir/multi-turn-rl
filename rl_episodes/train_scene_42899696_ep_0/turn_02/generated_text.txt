The current view shows a narrow hallway or corridor with a bed on the left and a curtain or partition on the right. Based on the question, I am starting at the TV facing the bed, and I need to navigate to the trash bin. The current position is at [0.54, 1.83, -0.49], which is likely near the entrance of the room or hallway. To reach the trash bin, I need to explore the area beyond the bed. The next logical step is to turn left to face the bed, which should be in front of me, then move forward to get a better view of the room and locate the trash bin.
