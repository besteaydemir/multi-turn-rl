The current view shows a narrow hallway or corridor with walls on both sides and a ceiling above. The perspective is looking down a hallway with a light source visible ahead. To answer the question, I need to determine the starting orientation relative to the TV and bed, and then figure out the correct turns to reach the trash bin. Since I'm at the TV facing the bed, I need to understand the spatial layout. The current view doesn't show a TV or bed, but it does show a path ahead. To navigate to the trash bin, I likely need to turn away from the direction I'm currently facing. The question indicates I should turn back first, then turn left, then go forward until I see the cabinet, then turn left again to reach the trash bin on my right. This suggests the initial turn should be "turn back" to reorient myself relative to the TV and bed.
