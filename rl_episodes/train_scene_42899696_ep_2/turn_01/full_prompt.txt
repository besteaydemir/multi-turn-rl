## Image History (numbered for reference):
  Image 0: position [x=0.24m, y=1.83m, z=-0.49m]
  Image 1: position [x=0.24m, y=1.83m, z=-0.49m]

Above are all the images you have seen so far in this exploration.


            You are given rendered views of a 3D room scene. You control the camera by specifying how to move it. 
            Your goal is to find the answer to the question below by exploring the scene with camera movements.

            Scene bounding box limits (meters):
  x: [-5.2, 5.7]
  y: [-2.2, 5.8]
  z: [-2.1, 2.6]



            # Current camera position: [0.24, 1.83, -0.49] (x, y, z in meters)
            # This is exploration step 1

            Question: If you begin navigating at the tv facing the bed. You want to navigate to the trash bin. You will perform the following actions (Note: for each [please fill in], choose either 'turn back,' 'turn left,' or 'turn right.'): 1. [please fill in] 2. Go forward until the cabinet 3. [please fill in] 4. Go forward until the trash bin is on your right. You have reached the final destination.
            
**Answer Options:**
  A) A. Turn Left, Turn Left
  B) B. Turn Right, Turn Left
  C) C. Turn Back, Turn Left
  D) D. Turn Right, Turn Right



            
**Note:** Your first task is to identify the starting place mentioned in the question.

            IMPORTANT: Keep exploring and DO NOT output an answer unless you are ready to stop (done=true). Answer and done=true should come together, not separately.

            DETAILED REASONING INSTRUCTIONS:

            1. **Analyze the current view thoroughly:**
            - What objects and areas are visible?
            - What areas are hidden or blocked from the current viewpoint?
            - What would you need to see to better answer the question?

            2. **Plan your camera movement:**
            - Decide how much to move forward/backward (toward/away from what you're looking at)
            - Decide how much to move left/right (perpendicular to where you're looking)
            - Think about what rotation (turning left/right) might help
            - Write out your reasoning in plain English before giving the JSON.

            3. **Specify the movement:**
            - `rotation_angle_degrees`: positive = turn left, negative = turn right (e.g., 15, -30, 90)
            - `forward_meters`: positive = move forward (in the direction you're facing), negative = move backward. Range: -0.5 to +0.5 meters
            - `left_meters`: positive = strafe left, negative = strafe right. Range: -0.5 to +0.5 meters
            - `z_delta_meters`: move up (+) or down (-) to change height. Range: -0.3 to +0.3 meters

            
4. **Do NOT stay in the same location.** Always provide at least one non-zero movement.

5. **Answering too early is a mistake.** ONLY output an answer (A, B, C, or D) when you have thoroughly explored the scene and are CERTAIN of your answer. 
   - Most of the time, you should NOT provide an answer yet - just explore and set "done": false.
   - Only when you are completely confident should you set both "answer": "X" AND "done": true together.
   - Never output an answer while still exploring (done=false). Either explore (no answer) OR finalize (answer + done=true).

6. **When you are confident:** If you have seen enough viewpoints and are absolutely certain of your answer, set "done": true AND provide your answer.

            FORMAT:

            First, write your detailed reasoning (3-4 sentences explaining what you see and why you're moving the camera, or why you're ready to finalize your answer).

            Then end with a JSON object:
            {
            "rotation_angle_degrees": <number, e.g., 15 or -30>,
            "forward_meters": <number between -0.5 and 0.5>,
            "left_meters": <number between -0.5 and 0.5>,
            "z_delta_meters": <number between -0.3 and 0.3>,
            "answer": "your final answer choice (A, B, C, or D) ONLY if done=true, otherwise null",
            "done": true or false
            }

            CRITICAL: "answer" and "done" should be consistent:
            - If done=false: answer MUST be null (you are still exploring)
            - If done=true: answer MUST be A, B, C, or D (you have decided to finalize)

Your previous movements and actions (IMPORTANT: Do not repeat these movements exactly - vary your exploration strategy):
  Step 1: Moved forward=0.00m, left=0.00m, up=0.00m, rotated=-90.0°

Avoid repeating these exact movements. Explore new areas of the scene.
