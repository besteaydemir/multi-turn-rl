I am currently at position [0.44, 1.83, -0.59] which is the starting point mentioned in the question. Looking at the current view, I am facing a wall with a light fixture, and to my right (which would be the right side of the frame), there appears to be a curtain or drape. Since I need to navigate from the TV facing the bed to the trash bin, and I'm currently facing the wall, I need to turn around to face the bed. However, the question's instructions for step 1 is to turn back, which would be a 180-degree turn to face away from the wall I'm currently looking at. This aligns with the need to reorient myself toward the bed. After turning back, I will proceed forward to reach the cabinet, then turn left to orient myself towards the trash bin's location. Therefore, the correct sequence of turns is 'turn back' followed by 'turn left'.
