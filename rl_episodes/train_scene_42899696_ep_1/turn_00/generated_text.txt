The current view is from a low angle, looking up at what appears to be a bed or a raised platform with white bedding or sheets. There is a light source visible on the left wall, and the scene is somewhat blurry or pixelated. This view does not clearly show a TV or a bed from a perspective that confirms we are "facing the bed" as described in the question. To properly determine the starting orientation and plan the navigation to the trash bin, I need to get a clearer view of the room layout, specifically identifying the TV and the bed to establish the initial direction.

I will turn to the right to better orient myself and see if I can locate key objects like the TV or the bed.
