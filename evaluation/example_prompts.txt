EXAMPLE 1: ROUTE PLANNING - EXPLORATION PHASE (Step 3/7)
================================================================================

You are an embodied agent exploring a 3D room to answer a spatial reasoning question.

**Your Position & Room Bounds:**
- Room dimensions: 4.7m (X) x 5.6m (Y)
- X range: [0.50, 5.20] meters
- Y range: [0.80, 6.40] meters  
- **Your current position:** X=2.50m, Y=3.10m, Z=1.60m

---
**TASK: Route Planning**
You need to understand a navigation route between objects in the room.
- First, locate the STARTING object mentioned (e.g., "beginning at the tv")
- Identify the DESTINATION object 
- Trace the route and determine which turns (left/right/back) are needed
- Consider the spatial layout from the robot's perspective at each step

**Question:** Beginning at the tv, you are facing the door. If you turn back, turn left, turn left, turn right, what do you end up facing?

**Answer Options:**
A. Turn Left, Turn Left
B. Turn Right, Turn Left
C. Turn Left, Turn Right
D. Turn Right, Turn Right

Step 3/7 - Combine rotation AND movement to explore efficiently!

**STEP 3/7 - EXPLORATION PHASE (4 steps remaining)**

🎯 **What to do this step:**
1. Look at the current image - what objects/features do you see?
2. Identify which objects from the question are visible (if any)
3. Plan where to move next to find missing objects or get better views
4. Execute BOTH rotation AND translation to reach new areas

⚙️ **Movement Controls** (rotation FIRST, then translation in new direction):
- **rotation_angle_degrees**: -90 to +90 (negative=right, positive=left)
- **forward_meters**: -1.0 to +1.0 (walk forward/back in your facing direction)
- **left_meters**: -0.5 to +0.5 (strafe left/right perpendicular to facing)

📐 **Examples:**
- Turn left and approach: {"rotation_angle_degrees": 60, "forward_meters": 0.8, "left_meters": 0.0, ...}
- Turn around and move: {"rotation_angle_degrees": 180, "forward_meters": 0.6, "left_meters": 0.0, ...}
- Strafe right while moving: {"rotation_angle_degrees": 0, "forward_meters": 0.7, "left_meters": -0.3, ...}
- Small adjustment: {"rotation_angle_degrees": 15, "forward_meters": 0.3, "left_meters": 0.1, ...}
- Large movement to opposite corner: {"rotation_angle_degrees": -45, "forward_meters": 1.0, "left_meters": 0.0, ...}

⚠️ **Critical: ACTUALLY MOVE!**
- Prefer combining rotation + forward movement in each step
- Don't just rotate in place (rotation=90, forward=0) - you'll stay in the same spot!
- The room is approximately 4.7m x 5.6m. Cover different areas efficiently to find all relevant objects.

❌ **Do NOT answer yet** unless you've seen all objects mentioned in the question!

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Think step-by-step:
1. What do I see in the current image?
2. What objects from the question have I found? What's still missing?
3. Where should I move next to find them?

Then output JSON:
```json
{
  "rotation_angle_degrees": <-90 to 90>,
  "forward_meters": <-1.0 to 1.0>,
  "left_meters": <-0.5 to 0.5>,
  "z_delta_meters": <-0.3 to 0.3>,
  "answer": <"A"/"B"/"C"/"D" or null>,
  "done": <true/false>
}
```

---
**Your movement history (avoid repeating):**
Step 1: rot=90°, fwd=0.5m, left=0.0m
Step 2: rot=-45°, fwd=0.7m, left=0.2m

EXAMPLE 2: OBJECT DISTANCE - FINAL STEP (Step 7/7)
================================================================================

You are an embodied agent exploring a 3D room to answer a spatial reasoning question.

**Your Position & Room Bounds:**
- Room dimensions: 4.7m (X) x 5.6m (Y)
- X range: [0.50, 5.20] meters
- Y range: [0.80, 6.40] meters  
- **Your current position:** X=2.50m, Y=3.10m, Z=1.60m

---
**TASK: Relative Distance Comparison**
You need to determine which object is CLOSEST to a reference object.
- Locate the reference object mentioned in the question
- Find ALL candidate objects listed in the options
- Compare their distances to the reference object
- Pick the CLOSEST one

**Question:** Which of the following objects is closest to the desk?

**Answer Options:**
A. chair
B. lamp
C. bed
D. cabinet

⚠️ FINAL STEP: Provide your answer now!

**⚠️ FINAL STEP 7/7 - ANSWER REQUIRED**

You have explored the scene. Based on ALL images you've seen:
- Choose the object that is closest (A, B, C, or D)
- Set "done": true in your JSON output

EXAMPLE 3: OBJECT DIRECTION (HARD) - EXPLORATION (Step 1/7)
================================================================================

You are an embodied agent exploring a 3D room to answer a spatial reasoning question.

**Your Position & Room Bounds:**
- Room dimensions: 4.7m (X) x 5.6m (Y)
- X range: [0.50, 5.20] meters
- Y range: [0.80, 6.40] meters  
- **Your current position:** X=2.50m, Y=3.10m, Z=1.60m

---
**TASK: Relative Direction**
You need to determine the direction of one object relative to another FROM A SPECIFIC VIEWPOINT.
- First, locate WHERE you would be standing (e.g., "standing by the stove")
- Then, determine which direction you would be FACING (e.g., "facing the tv")  
- From that perspective, determine where the TARGET object is (left/right/front-left/etc.)
- Mentally place yourself at that position and orientation

**Question:** You are standing by the stove facing the tv. What direction is the sofa relative to you?

**Answer Options:**
A. left
B. right
C. back
D. front
